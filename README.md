# SignForge Backend API

The SignForge Backend API is built using Node.js and Express to power the SignForge Digital Signage system. It provides users with the ability to manage assets, players, messages, and playlists for a seamless digital signage experience.

## Features

- Asset management: Allows users to upload and manage assets in an Amazon AWS bucket, which are then served to the SignForge Player.
- Player management: Users can create, update, and delete players with unique IDs and friendly names for the SignForge Player.
- Message management: Enables users to create, update, and delete dynamic and eye-catching digital signage messages from templates.
- Playlist functionality: Allows users to update the order of messages on each play.

## How It Works

The SignForge Backend API is built on Node.js and Express, offering a robust and scalable solution for managing the SignForge Digital Signage system. Users can easily manage their assets, players, messages, and playlists, ensuring that their digital signage remains up-to-date and engaging.

By integrating with the [SignForge Player](https://github.com/alexrobinett/SignForge-Player), the backend API provides seamless content updates and playlist management, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Future Plans

- Enhance the API with additional features and optimizations for better performance and scalability.
- Integrate with the upcoming SignForge CMS to provide an all-in-one digital signage management solution.
